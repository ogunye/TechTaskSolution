# Checkout 

## Overview

The Checkout project is a coding exercise designed to simulate a checkout system for a supermarket. In this system, items are identified by Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), represented by individual letters (A, B, C, etc.). Each item has a unit price, and some items have special pricing rules when bought in bulk.

## Features

- **Dynamic Pricing:** The system can handle dynamic pricing rules, allowing you to pass in unit prices and special pricing rules when initializing the checkout.
- **Flexible Scanning:** Items can be scanned in any order, and the system will correctly apply unit prices and special prices.
- **Total Price Calculation:** The system calculates the total price based on the scanned items and applicable special pricing rules.
